# Machine-Learning-Project-Software-Deployment
Machine learning software is deployed using Python tkinter framework.
Machine learning Algorithms like Classification,Regression and Clustering algorithms are used.
The Classification Techniques like Logistic regression,Naive Bayes,KNN,SVM Classification,Decision Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification are used.
The Regression Algorithms like Simple Linear Regression,Multiple Linear Regression,Polynomial Regression,SVM Regression,Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression are used.
The Clustering Techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering are used.
The Results are predicted with Accuracy.
The Datasets are given in csv file format for better understanding.
